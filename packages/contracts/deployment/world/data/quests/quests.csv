Everyone’s got one. If you don’t, I’m selling them for a reasonable price. 

MINA: Once you’ve acquired both a Spice Grinder and a Portable Burner, you’ll be ready to craft a variety of basic hexerei. There are some recipes that will require different tools, but I’ll cover that if you manage to make it to advanced lessons. For now, I need to know if you’re even capable of brewing a simple potion. 

MINA: Potions let your Kami accomplish great feats; they’ll be able to harvest more efficiently, get a jump on enemies or escape their clutches, attack with more passion, or more. One of the purest feats is to grow and learn, and so one of the simplest potions is a hex to boost skill growth.

MIN011,2011,To Update,Hex Education,No,"MINA: Now that you’re equipped and accomplished, try something slightly more delicate. Grind the Daffodil that I had you collect earlier, then take a small quantity and brew it with care.

MINA: This is a simple task, so be quick about it and get back to me. ","Complete MIN007,Complete MIN010",Craft 1 Bless Potion,2x Elders Loyalty,SHOP,MINA
MIN012,2012,To Update,Eye of the White Snake,No,"MINA: Have I introduced you to my pet? His name is Ahi. It’s a nickname of someone I knew long, long ago. He’s a perfect sweetheart and very obedient, nothing like the original. That one was quite the attention-getter. For a time I was fascinated and could think of no one else. Eventually, like with most things, I got bored and moved on. He didn’t want to let go so easily and put up quite a fight.

MINA: Deep inside the forest is a splayed oak, its innards ripe with a crystalline growth. The color reminds me of his eyes. Get me a crystal from the trunk as a memento. ",Complete MIN011,Give 1 Red Amber Crystal,6x Elders Loyalty,SHOP,MINA
MIN013,2013,To Update,Memorial for the Forgotten,No,"MINA: The state of this graveyard is an insult to those buried here. To have graves in a place like this means something. Somewhere very special has become a dumping ground for all sorts of disorganized trash, but there seems to be no changing it now. 

MINA: Reminiscing about that lost friend has gotten me sentimental. He’s not one of the dead here, of course, even I’m not familiar with the origins of this world. Still, they deserve something. There’s far too much trash to pick up, but let’s lay down something beautiful for a change.",Complete MIN012,"Move to the Trash-Strewn Graves,Give 15 Daffodil",4x Elders Loyalty,SHOP,MINA
MIN014,2014,To Update,To Whom It May Concern,No,"MINA: It appears there’s more to this Menu being than I first thought. She’s intimately tied to this place, a sort of genius loci, that is not a god or a person, but some form of protective entity that exists within the spiritual fabric of the location. As much as I and my shop are connected, she is with the Kamigotchi World.

MINA: A rare error on my part. As soon as possible, I’ll send over an apology letter. I just need you to help me find the necessary materials.","Complete MIN013,Complete MSQ030","Give 2 Wooden Sticks,Give 125 Sanguineous Powder,Give 125 Resin Tincture",4x Elders Loyalty,SHOP,MINA
MIN015,2015,To Update,A Matter of Import,No,"MINA: Menu tells me she wants something out of the machine by the lost skeleton. I might be able to conjure a device that will help. The power of electricity is rare, but not unknown to those from my time. 

MINA: I’ll need 9999 MUSU to cover the import. You’re getting a great deal, the lowest price I can possibly get. 

MINA: P.S. She’s told me that I don’t need to sign my messages. Is that true? Are you able to discern who offered you this quest without a signature?",Complete MIN014,Give 9999 $MUSU,"4x Elders Loyalty,1x Pyramid Engine (Soulbound)",SHOP,MINA
SQ001,3001,To Update,Rejecting Fate,No,"MENU: All Kamigotchi can succeed, from the Commons to the Epics. When raising a Kami, take advantage of their strengths. Build on the foundation of their initial stats. Choose skills that boost what your Kami is already best at before shoring up weaknesses.

MENU: If you would prefer to raise a different Kami entirely, the option is available. It might be the case that you love robots and want a team of Scrap Kami. Maybe you’re a dark, edgy person, so you want Kami that are inclined to maximum violence. It could even be that you’re searching for one of the rumored Legendary Kami.

MENU: If you have $ONYX, you can use the Vending Machine in the scrapyard to Reroll a Kamigotchi. After you purchase a Reroll Ticket, you can use it to return one Kami to the pool. In exchange, a new Kami will emerge to join you. ",Complete MSQ003,Reroll one Kamigotchi,2x Agency Reputation,SIDE,MENU
SQ002,3002,To Update,Health & Safety,No,"MENU: While Kami don’t see Harvesting as labor, they still get tired and lose Health. Kamigotchi hold their bodies together with spiritual energy. As they expend energy, it gets harder to maintain their form. Low Health doesn’t mean a Kami is physically hurt, but it’s still a problem you should take care of.

MENU: When your Kami gets low on Health, return to the room where you left it, then use the Harvesting Menu to pick it up. A Kami will slowly regenerate Health on its own while being held. If you can’t wait, give your Kami a snack or use a Spell Card to restore health. Kamigotchi don’t need food to live, but they can draw energy from food to bolster their spirit.

MENU: Use an item to heal a Kami and complete this quest. If you already used the Spell Card that I gave you, go buy some food or dig up a Cheeseburger. ",Complete MSQ004,Use an item to heal a Kamigotchi that has been reduced below 100% Health,"2x Agency Reputation,1x ""Neith’s River of Life"" Spell Card",SIDE,MENU
SQ003,3003,To Update,There Are Levels to This,No,"MENU: Unlike humans, Kamigotchi have the potential to grow and change by using xenoplasticity, or “XP” for short. This means that they can assimilate many different things to form a new cohesive whole.

MENU: Take a look at your roster. You can see a green progress bar with a percentage indicator beneath the portrait of each Kami. When one is ready to move to the next level, the bar will be full and read 100%. Just level up a Kami and you’ll be done. Take note of your new skill point and hold onto it for the next quest.

SQ004,3004,To Update,Skill Issue,No,"MENU: When you spend Skill Points to tell Kami what to focus on, you shape their personalities and temperaments. Think hard before you make a choice! You’ll only be able to respec with specific items that are difficult to acquire. This is a commitment.

MENU: Click on a Kami that leveled up and gained a skill point recently and look over the skill tree. Remember, you can’t go wrong by improving what your Kami is already good at. Take your time, but don’t forget to pick something. ",Complete SQ003,Spend a point in any Skill Tree after levelling up,2x Agency Reputation,SIDE,MENU
SQ005,3005,To Update,Spring Rites,No,"MENU: I see one of your Kami got Liquidated. That sucks! Of course, that’s just a temporary condition. Usually in this world it’s possible to return to form no matter what happens. The essence of something remains unless it’s been totally erased from existence.

MENU: Take this and use it on a Kami that has been Liquidated. Just read the incantation printed on the front, and presto! This powerful spell card brings your Kami back to action. 

MENU: It’s the only freebie I’m allowed to give you. You’ll have to work for more spell cards like this one. Certain shopkeepers might sell different kinds of revival magic, but these cards are premium SSR.",Have one of your own Kami liquidated,,"2x Agency Reputation,1x “Melkarth’s Heroic Awakening” Spell Card",SIDE,MENU
SQ006,3006,To Update,What’s In a Name?,No,"MENU: Southeast through the old forest you can find a small shrine by a mountain waterfall. That area was cultivated for spiritual power. With the rare Holy Dust item, you can perform a ritual there to grant your Kami a name.

MENU: If you don’t have Holy Dust, a small donation of $ONYX to the shrine will suffice!",Complete MSQ008,Name a Kami,2x Agency Reputation,SIDE,MENU
SQ007,3007,To Update,Land Survey,No,"MENU: Your march helped find an interesting anomaly, but I’m positive something else is hidden around here. I’ve checked and re-checked more times than you’d care to hear about. Something still doesn’t line up! It’s going to take a lot of legwork to figure this one out.

MENU: Move 500 times. I’ll be going over everything again with a fine-tooth comb. We’re bound to find something by the end.",Complete MSQ017,Move 500 times,"2x Agency Reputation,2x “Neith’s River of Life” Spell Card",SIDE,MENU
SQ008,3008,To Update,Peregrination,No,"MENU: They say measure twice, cut once, but that still means taking a risk. Best to measure a thousand times for the most accurate data. Sometimes the numbers might have changed.

MENU: Even if you’ve already found something interesting, please move 1000 times more. Cover every inch of this world. I’ll scan as you go. We need to be sure.",Complete SQ007,Move 1000 times,"4x Agency Reputation,3x “Neith’s River of Life” Spell Card",SIDE,MENU
SQ009,3009,To Update,Tips Help The Most Right Now,No,"MINA: I demand a tribute of $MUSU. You should feel privileged to be given this opportunity and expect nothing in return. Still, I’ll give you something whether you deserve it or not. No, I’ll never give a discount, but you’ll have my attention. Isn’t that even better?",Complete MIN008,Give 5000 $MUSU,6x Elders Loyalty,SIDE,MINA
SQ010,3010,To Update,Hex Education II,No,"MINA: I suppose I should persist through the boredom and finish the hexing lessons. You’re a fine student and have proved yourself loyal and reliable, so it shouldn’t take long to get this over with.

MINA: A slightly more complex recipe: The Grace Potion. It allows a Kami to harvest for longer periods of time by boosting its ability to endure the strain. The potion’s active ingredient is the exceedingly rare Black Poppy. Hidden in the undergrowth, it emerges from the shadows only when it wants to be found. A great degree of patience or luck is necessary when searching for it.

MINA: Of course, this flower is very potent. When crafting your hexes, I recommend that you use only a small amount.",Complete MIN013,Craft 1 Grace Potion,2x Elders Loyalty,SIDE,MINA
SQ011,3011,To Update,Hex Education III,No,"MINA: A simple but powerful recipe, this potion is capable of undoing the many mistakes you’ve no doubt made when raising your Kami. The key ingredient is Mint. While common elsewhere, it grows in only a few places in this world and rarely spreads.

MINA: Find one Mint and grind it up, you’ll need every single shred for one potion. It’s an elusive reagent, so be patient while you’re on the hunt. Hexers of the past would obsess over the search for rare ingredients and fall to madness for things like this. However, you’ve always seemed unusually dry, so perhaps you’ll handle the stress with ease. ",Complete SQ010,Craft 1 Respec Potion,2x Elders Loyalty,SIDE,MINA
SQ012,3012,To Update,Customer Loyalty Program II,No,"MINA: On the wall in my shop hangs a board tracking my favorite customers. That could be you one day at the top among the angels.

SQ013,3013,To Update,Going Out For a Coffee,No,"MINA: I came across this beverage long ago when I met the peoples of Lake Shala, who offered this drink to the gods as appeasement. I was quite taken by its taste, though I can’t recall when I last had it. We don’t have access to the original ingredients here, but I believe materials are available to craft an approximation of the flavor. 

MINA: Start by crafting a proper receptacle: Chisel a chunk of Stone with a Screwdriver to make an Empty Cup. You might think it possible to drink this potion from a plastic bottle or a glass jar, but it isn’t. Only a proper stone cup will do. For the approximate materials, seek out a Sanguine Shroom for the color and body, and a Pine Cone for the dry finish and spicy floral aroma. It may sound unpleasant, but wait until it’s been brewed before you judge.",Complete SQ012,Craft 1 Hostility Potion,4x Elders Loyalty,SIDE,MINA
SQ014,3014,To Update,Teatime,No,"MINA: I just gave you a lesson to craft a useful potion with Mint, I know, but could you put that aside for a moment? With the mint on my mind, I’d like a cup of tea.

SQ015,3015,To Update,The Wages of Sin,No,"MENU: I noticed some strange coins in your inventory. The design is a little like an ancient Greek obol, but there’s something off about the metal, it’s too pure for the era. And the way they catch the light and glitter despite being so dull, it’s not right. 

MENU: Give me a handful to take a closer look at. I’ll run a battery of tests. ",Own at least 1 Obol,Give 5 Obols,"2x Agency Reputation,1x Booster Pack",SIDE,MENU
SQ016,3016,To Update,Go Suck An Egg,No,"MENU: I know there’s a window on me somewhere, a secret shop where you can use those Obols to buy something. Don’t tell me it’s not real, I can tell it’s there. They refuse to sell to me, so you’re gonna have to shell out just this once.

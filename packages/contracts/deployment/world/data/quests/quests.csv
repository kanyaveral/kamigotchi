MSQ002,2,In Game,Beginning Your Journey,No,"Feel like you’re getting the hang of my interface? Great! Now that you’re oriented, you can start exploring your surroundings. You move around by using the Map Menu at the top left of your screen. Navigate over to the scrapyard and check it out.

Explore the world a little, then check back in with me. I’ll give you a Spell Card. These work even if you don’t believe in magic. Using this card will restore your Stamina so you can move around more! ",Complete MSQ001,Move 3 Times,"1x ""Neith’s River of Life"" Spell Card"

Have you seen the Vending Machine out in the junkyard? Believe it or not, we’ve got it powered on, fully stocked, and plugged in… but not to an electrical outlet! I’ll explain more later, but for now, just get yourself a Kami.",Complete MSQ002,Own 1 Kamigotchi,6x Agency Reputation
MSQ004,4,In Game,What Kami Do: Harvesting,No,"Kamigotchi remain at rest when being held, but when you let them out to run around, they really get busy!

We call it “Harvesting”, but they harvest passively, not through labor. When a Kami is placed down in the world, they draw a kind of energy out of the environment and into themselves. We call this energy $MUSU. I’ll explain it in more detail later.

You can wander to other Rooms while your Kami are Harvesting, but don’t forget where you left them! Tired Kami are vulnerable to predators. 

When you’re done, I’ll give you an XP Candy - you can use this to help level up your Kamigotchi! ",Complete MSQ003,Harvest for >5 minutes,1x XP Candy (Small)
MSQ005,5,In Game,What Kami Do: Scavenging,No,"$MUSU isn’t the only thing the Kamigotchi collect. Over time, the Harvesting action generates a force that draws objects and items to the Kami, like a kind of gravity that only seems to affect specific things.

Which things? It’s not clear. The selection changes based on your Kami’s location. Some are simply fallen sticks and old stones, but other items are more interesting. We call this action “Scavenging”.

Try this out for yourself. See what kind of present the Kami brings you!",Complete MSQ004,Scavenge 1 Item,4x Agency Reputation
MSQ006,6,In Game,What Kami Do: Liquidating,No,"If your Kami isn’t really enjoying Harvesting, it may not be built for such a relaxed existence. A Kami with a high Violence may find it lucrative to conflict with its peers. 

Predatory Kami may use their violent nature to Liquidate other Kami and gain large amounts of $MUSU in the process. This may be antisocial, but there’s no harm done. Just like a Kami isn’t really hurt when it’s low on Health, a Kami isn’t really dead when it’s Liquidated. It may not be able to hold its body in shape, but it can always come back!",Complete MSQ005,Liquidate another Kamigotchi,4x Agency Reputation
MSQ007,7,In Game,Making $MUSU,No,"$MUSU is a form of energy that exists everywhere in the universe. This Kamigotchi World has a particularly high concentration. $MUSU is what keeps everything here tied together like the knots in a big rope net.

MSQ008,8,In Game,Supporting Local Businesses,No,"In this world and the places that surround it, $MUSU is also a kind of currency. If you need a specific item, someone might sell just what you need, for the right price. You might even get the itch to start trading goods yourself!

Go spend some $MUSU just to get the hang of it. If you need directions, there’s a shop through the door a little north of the vending machine. I’ve heard it trades some interesting things! When you’re done shopping, I’ll give you something extra. It’s on the house. ",Complete MSQ007,Buy something from any vendor using $MUSU,2x Agency Reputation
MSQ009,9,In Game,Building a Reputation,No,"You can gain a number of different rewards by completing Quests, from new items to new game mechanics. One type of quest reward might not seem useful immediately, but over time it will really pay off! I’m talking about Reputation. That number represents your status in the eyes of another: Me.

As the Menu, I’m the interface that you the Player uses to pilot your Operator around the Kamigotchi World. Straightforward, right? I’m as friendly as it gets, so raising your Reputation with me is easy. Usually I’ll always give between 2 to 6 Reputation for completing quests, but sometimes if it’s super difficult or I think it’s important, I’ll give out more.

For example: I want to build new circuitry. If you give me the raw materials, I can fabricate it for myself. Please give me some Scrap Metal. I’d really appreciate it!",Complete MSQ008,Give 3 Scrap Metal,"6x Agency Reputation,1x “Paeon’s Field of Flowers” Spell Card"
MSQ010,10,In Game,Kamigotchi World and You: Having a Normal One,No,"Almost every area in the Kamigotchi World has a Type just like your Kami. The “Normal” type is self-explanatory. Something with the Normal Type represents the essence of this world in its purest form.

MSQ011,11,In Game,Kamigotchi World and You: That Eerie Feeling,No,"A Kami or Room with the “Eerie” type comes into being when the natural state of things gets changed by something supernatural.

MSQ012,12,In Game,Kamigotchi World and You: Insects in the Miasma,No,"The Insect type might make your skin crawl. It’s not always about seeing the bugs, you know? An Insect-Type Room is the kind of place that makes you feel defiled. But not always because of actual filth, either. It’s more of a vibe. 

If you want to really feel what I mean, scavenge three items in rooms with the Insect type.",Complete MSQ011,Make a Scavenging roll in 3 rooms of the Insect type,4x Agency Reputation
MSQ013,13,In Game,Kamigotchi World and You: Tossed in the Scrap Heap,No,"Like they say, one person’s trash is another person’s treasure! I shouldn’t call it trash, though. A Scrap Type isn’t defined as waste material that has been discarded, but as a small part of a greater whole.

People have the power to make tangible change by expressing their will, creating attachments with desire, leaving behind memories, and more. The remnants of those material attachments can end up as Scrap.

MSQ014,14,In Game,Identifying Materials: Wood,No,"Everything in the Kamigotchi World has a story, even the rocks and trees. You might have picked up some Wooden Sticks while Harvesting. There are trees all over, that’s nothing special, right?

Well, here’s a rumor: Those trees are all branches of one huge tree, connected by the roots! That’s why all the Wooden Sticks you’ll find are pretty much the same, no matter where you pick them up.

I’d like to analyze the wood’s structure in detail. Collect 5 Wooden Sticks for me, and I’ll give you a reward. ",Complete MSQ013,Give 5 Wooden Sticks,4x Agency Reputation
MSQ015,15,In Game,Identifying Materials: Stone,No,"Nothing more basic than a rock, right? Well, sometimes a rock isn’t just a rock. Sometimes it really “rocks”!

…I’m sorry. What I mean is: The structure of these rocks doesn’t always make geological sense. It’s natural for them to look a little different, because the Kamigotchi World doesn’t follow the same rules as the physical world. But some of these rocks look more like pieces of bone!

I don’t know what it means, but I’d like to take a closer look. Collect 5 Rocks for me, and I’ll give you a reward. ",Complete MSQ014,Give 5 Stone,4x Agency Reputation

MSQ017,17,In Game,Exploring Other Options,No,"Thank you for the help with that upgrade. I’ve gotten access to more information. Checking databases against each other has led me to discover this world is bigger than it seems! I know we’ll get into the labs one day, but there are even more sealed-off places to find here.

The holes in my memory are getting frustrating. I don’t know how I’m going to act if I can’t clear some of this up soon. Bear with me for a while, okay? I have one more thing to try. A long, thorough, final search around the map, clockwise from the top. If we don’t find anything this time around… 

We’ll find something. Start at Scrap Trees and dig around. I’ll connect to your Kami and share what they learn. Those bisected items belonged to someone. What cut them in half? Who used to own them?

Even if we don’t find something with a direct connection to the office, I feel like we’re on the right track. Next, visit the Blooming Tree and make scavenging rolls. 

There aren’t any storms here. In fact, the weather in this place is always very clear. Did something other than lightning blast that tree apart? It stands alone, away from the others. Was it somehow special before it was destroyed? Is it currently important? Red Amber Crystal is only found there, for some reason.

MSQ024,24,In Game,Squaring the Circle IV,No,"Visit the Airplane Crash and scavenge around in there with your Kami. 

I haven’t mentioned that plane until now, but that’s because I have no clue where it came from or what it’s doing here. I’m supposed to have pretty thorough map data for this area! It’s not a gap I feel the absence from, this thing is a genuine foreign body.

I admit I’m a little scared of Mina. She’s also completely new to my records, like that crashed jet, but Mina is alive. And independent. And powerful. She’s been giving you quests, I can read them too, you know. So she can take control over parts of the game… It’s spooky.

But on the other hand, this also makes it more likely that she can help. What would be a nice welcoming gift for someone like that? Flowers? No, no, I’ve got the perfect idea.

Raw materials can be broken down into ingredients for hexerei. One can craft potions, poultices, and other things if one knows the methods. I’m selling something in my shop to help you along with this: a device to break down ingredients for yourself. I won’t be doing it for you again.

MIN008,2008,In Game,Offering an Apprenticeship,No,"Some may view a scavenging Kami like a magpie on the hunt for treasure. The truth is the other way around; objects of sentiment are naturally drawn to the Kami. Wealth accumulates without desire, and the Kami tend to rest on their hoards like little dragons. As a companion of the Kami, you can share in these treasures and put them to better use. 

For example, you could practice alchemy, or the ancient art of Hexerei. With the right tools and a proper education, you can craft scavenged items into potions and spells. Through Hexerei you might improve your accumulation of $MUSU, which would of course allow you to give more of it to me.

If you don’t, I’m selling them for a reasonable price. 

Once you’ve acquired both a Spice Grinder and a Portable Burner, you’ll be ready to craft a variety of basic hexerei. There are some recipes that will require different tools, but I’ll cover that if you manage to make it to advanced lessons. For now, I need to know if you’re even capable of brewing a simple potion. 

Potions let your Kami accomplish great feats; they’ll be able to harvest more efficiently, get a jump on enemies or escape their clutches, attack with more passion, or more. One of the purest feats is to grow and learn, and so one of the simplest potions is a hex to boost skill growth. Craft an XP Potion by combining Pine Pollen and a Plastic Bottle.

Eventually, like with most things, I got bored and moved on. He didn’t want to let go so easily and put up quite a fight.

I’ve checked and re-checked more times than you’d care to hear about. Something still doesn’t line up! It’s going to take a lot of legwork to figure this one out.

SQ010,3010,In Game,Hex Education II,No,"I suppose I should persist through the boredom and finish the hexing lessons. You’re a fine student and have proved yourself loyal and reliable, so it shouldn’t take long to get this over with.

A slightly more complex recipe: The Grace Potion. It allows a Kami to harvest for longer periods of time by boosting its ability to endure the strain. The potion’s active ingredient is the exceedingly rare Black Poppy. Hidden in the undergrowth, it emerges from the shadows only when it wants to be found. A great degree of patience or luck is necessary when searching for it.

Of course, this flower is very potent. When crafting your hexes, I recommend that you use only a small amount.

SQ011,3011,In Game,Hex Education III,No,"A simple but powerful recipe, this potion is capable of undoing the many mistakes you’ve no doubt made when raising your Kami. The key ingredient is Mint. While common elsewhere, it grows in only a few places in this world and rarely spreads.

Find one Mint and grind it up, you’ll need every single shred for one potion. It’s an elusive reagent, so be patient while you’re on the hunt. Hexers of the past would obsess over the search for rare ingredients and fall to madness for things like this. However, you’ve always seemed unusually dry, so perhaps you’ll handle the stress with ease.

SQ013,3013,In Game,Going Out For a Coffee,No,"I came across this beverage long ago when I met the peoples of Lake Shala, who offered this drink to the gods as appeasement. I was quite taken by its taste, though I can’t recall when I last had it. We don’t have access to the original ingredients here, but I believe materials are available to craft an approximation of the flavor. 

Start by crafting a proper receptacle: Chisel a chunk of Stone with a Screwdriver to make an Empty Cup. You might think it possible to drink this potion from a plastic bottle or a glass jar, but it isn’t. Only a proper stone cup will do. For the approximate materials, seek out a Sanguine Shroom for the color and body, and a Pine Cone for the dry finish and spicy floral aroma. It may sound unpleasant, but wait until it’s been brewed before you judge.

SQ015,3015,In Game,The Wages of Sin,No,"I noticed some strange coins in your inventory. The design is a little like an ancient Greek obol, but there’s something off about the metal, it’s too pure for the era. And the way they catch the light and glitter despite being so dull, it’s not right.
